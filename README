# Final-Project
STUFF TO DO: 
HI COPY EVERYTHING BC I ADDED ASHE 

Fighting
-abilities** find champion classes at the bottom of board.java
-make champions not overlap each other when fighting (like minion block) - maybe this is too hard

Game
oh true good idea - I think we should make levels with semi-random ai teams(like pick from a small list)

Menu
Improve instructions

Other
-make effect for elemental origin 



Notes
Graphics 2 
-texture brush, gradiant brush, and other stuff to make it look good later
